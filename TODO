*Add haddocks everywhere possible.
*Add all private method skeletons.
*Generalise public and private methods.
*Add PostEncodeable instances for all relevant records.
*Generalise generalised methods and move them to Network.Bitcoin.BitX.Internal.
*Perhaps create (orphaned) instances for ToJSON Decimal and FromJSON Decimal?
*Investigate NOT writing JSON instances explicitely for simple lists of instances (where am I doing this?).
*Seriously rethink design of Balance(s)...
